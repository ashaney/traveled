Code Review Analysis

I've thoroughly reviewed the PNG export implementation. Here's my comprehensive feedback:

Todo List:

 Read and analyze all changed files
 Review the dual export strategy architecture
 Check code quality and TypeScript implementation
 Analyze error handling and user experience
 Provide comprehensive review feedback
✅ Strengths

Smart Architectural Design

Dual Strategy: SVG-first with html2canvas fallback is excellent - avoids oklch issues entirely in primary path
Clean Separation: Two focused hooks with single responsibilities
Performance: SVG serialization is faster than DOM manipulation
Robust Error Handling

Comprehensive Fallbacks: Multiple fallback strategies in useMapExport.ts:226-242
Proper Cleanup: URL revocation and DOM cleanup in both hooks
User Feedback: Loading states and error toasts in component
TypeScript Implementation

Good Type Safety: Proper interfaces and return types
Flexible Options: Well-designed option interfaces for customization
⚠️ Areas for Improvement

Code Quality Issues

1. Hard-coded Color Mappings (useMapExport.ts:55-125)

// This creates maintenance burden - colors may change
--background: #ffffff !important;
--foreground: #0a0a0a !important;
Suggestion: Consider reading actual computed CSS custom properties dynamically instead of hard-coding.

2. Missing Edge Cases (useMapExportSvg.ts:67-68)

if (fillColor && fillColor !== 'none' && !fillColor.includes('oklch')) {
  element.setAttribute('fill', fillColor);
}
Issue: What if fillColor contains other unsupported CSS functions (e.g., lab(), lch())?

3. Inconsistent Error Types
Both hooks use generic string for errors. Consider creating specific error types:

type ExportError = 'ELEMENT_NOT_FOUND' | 'CANVAS_CONTEXT_FAILED' | 'IMAGE_LOAD_FAILED';
Performance Considerations

4. Blocking Operations (useMapExport.ts:203)

await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
Issue: Fixed delays can cause unnecessary waiting or race conditions.
Suggestion: Use requestAnimationFrame or style computation callbacks.

5. Memory Leaks Risk (useMapExport.ts:186-196)
The clone container approach could leave elements if errors occur before cleanup.

User Experience

6. Limited Progress Feedback
Only shows pulse animation - users might want progress percentage for large maps.

7. No File Size Warnings
Large maps could generate huge files - consider warning users.

🛠️ Specific Recommendations

High Priority

Dynamic Color Resolution (useMapExport.ts:51-147):

const getComputedCSSVariables = () => {
  const root = document.documentElement;
  const computed = getComputedStyle(root);
  // Build override map dynamically
};
Enhanced Error Types:

interface ExportResult {
  success: boolean;
  error?: ExportError;
  canvas?: HTMLCanvasElement;
}
Cleanup Safety (useMapExport.ts:236-242):

try {
  // ... export logic
} finally {
  // Ensure cleanup always happens
  Promise.resolve().then(() => {
    removeFallbacks(fallbackStyle);
    cleanupClonedElements();
  });
}
Medium Priority

CSS Function Detection:

const hasUnsupportedCSS = (value: string) => 
  /\b(oklch|lab|lch|color-mix)\b/.test(value);
Progress Tracking: Add export progress callbacks for better UX

File Size Limits: Add warnings for exports exceeding reasonable sizes

🔒 Security Review

✅ No direct DOM manipulation security issues
✅ Proper URL cleanup prevents memory leaks
✅ No user input injection vulnerabilities
📊 Overall Assessment

Rating: 8/10 - This is a solid, well-architected implementation that solves a complex problem elegantly.

Key Wins:

Solves the oklch compatibility problem cleverly
Clean architecture with good separation of concerns
Comprehensive error handling and fallback strategies
Good TypeScript usage
Main Concerns:

Hard-coded color mappings create maintenance burden
Some edge cases around CSS function detection
Could benefit from more specific error types
The implementation is production-ready as-is, but the suggested improvements would make it more robust and maintainable long-term.
